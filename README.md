# dataVis

I made this page to practice using APIs and displaying data changing over time. My inspiration was Hans Rosling, you should definitely watch this very short video of him presenting moving data. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo

This page shows population over time. I've chosen to use the number of 60 year olds as there is sufficient data available from api.population.io to see the effects of WW2 and the depression on the population.

The size of the bubbles is proportional to population. The x axis is linear time and covers the last 70 years. The y axis shows the change over time relative to the starting population.
