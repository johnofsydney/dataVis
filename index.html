    <p>This page shows population over time. I've chosen to use the number of 60 year olds as there is sufficient data available from api.population.io to see the effects of WW2 and the depression on the population.</p>
    <p>The size of the bubbles is proportional to population. The x axis is linear time and covers the last 70 years. The y axis shows the change over time relative to the starting population.</p>
    <p>Click the button above to start, try as many countries as you like, you might have to check <a href="http://population.io">population.io</a> for accurate country names.</p>
